\section{System architecture}
The paradigm choosen for our application is Client-Server.
Each user will connect to a remote server in order to use the application.
The design model is a three-tier application (Presentation, Middleware, Back-end).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Client: The client part of the application is composed by two main components, a front end which manage the user interaction and a middleware that will handle the requests from the user and the response from the server side.
	\item Server: The server part is, similarly to the client, divided in two parts, middleware to handle the requests coming from the client side and a DBManager which will perform queries on the database.  
\end{enumerate}

The entire application will be developed in Java, following an object oriented model. The DB used will be an SQL one, more precisely we will use MySQL DBMS.
